    <div class="card">
        <p>A picture from the peaceful past, back when we hadn't been aware how careless our lives are. This picture is a reminder of life's unfairness as before I can still go to a bar or cafe with a friend, talking about nothing and everything, but someone will be protecting our calm day and night - and I don’t and will not ever get enough money, energy or lifetime to pay them back. The only thing left is try to support. It is unlikely that life will become fair at any point. But we can still try to do our part to change something, at least a tiny little bit.</p>
        <p>· The goal is to raise money to buy night vision. They can be provided by the government only for elite structures, like special forces. They are quite expensive. But (a reminder): still save lives.</p>
